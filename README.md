# Insectary comparison

This is a project to determine whether the insectary environment affects mosquito microbiome composition. 

## About

A batch of Aedes aegypti eggs were split and reared concurrently in three different insectaries at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. 16S rRNA data was then generated from mosquitoes at different life stages as well as from their environment and food sources and environemtnal conditions were also measured. The data were then compared across the three insectaries.

The manuscript is currently on biorxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.28.610121. However, it has now been peer reviewed and accepted for publication and the doi will be updated when available.
