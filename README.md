# insectary_comparison
This is a project to determine whether the insectary environment affects mosquito microbiome composition. 16S rRNA data was analysed for mosquitoes of various life stages reared concurrently in three different insectaries at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. This maunscript 'Mosquitoes reared in distinct insectaries within an institution in close spatial proximity possess significantly divergent microbiomes' is currently on biorxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.28.610121
